Finally 『Even We Are Goodness』 is end with a confess that maybe the narrators who are the essence of goodness are led the our world to the hell. Some narrator was ”leaved you while dying” even he is goodness, Some narrator was blamed ”You never fucking know what it is that the totally broken my life by the one who I mostly loved” from the one who most loved, even he is goodness. And some narrator manifesto that ”It was how to successfully lock up my colossal dragon to my closet”, even he is goodness.
